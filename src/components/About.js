      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I'm Christophe, a dedicated professional with a strong academic background in Statistics and Econometrics.
        My expertise lies in applying diverse statistical and mathematical methods and tools to real-world challenges. [cite: 3]
        Currently, I'm working as a Research Engineer at INRIA - PreMeDICAL, focusing on missing data imputation and classification with incomplete datasets. [cite: 5]
      </p>
      <p>
        My academic journey includes a Bachelor's in Econometrics and Operations Research from Maastricht University (GPA: 9.37/10, Summa Cum Laude)[cite: 3], and a Master's in Statistics from ETH ZÃ¼rich (GPA: 5.75/6, Distinction)[cite: 1, 2]. I've also had the privilege of studying abroad at UCLA and participating in the Bachelor Honours programme at Maastricht University. [cite: 4]

      <p>
        I have experience contributing to the future of European banking supervision through cutting-edge technologies during my traineeship at the European Central Bank[cite: 6]. I've also undertaken data-based projects to improve app user and revenue growth as a Junior Data Analyst at Hornet, Queer Social Network[cite: 7].
      </p>
      <p>
        In September 2025, I will be starting my DPhil (PhD) in Statistics at the University of Oxford, where I look forward to delving deeper into advanced research.
      </p>
      <p>
        Outside of my professional pursuits, I am a six-time semi-finalist of the Mathematical Olympiad of Belgium [cite: 11] and enjoy discovering citizen and political life through the Communal Council of Children[cite: 12].
